# TITLE
Horiseon website rework


## DESCRIPTION
Horiseon had asked me to go into there code and rework it to make it more user friendly and clean.
My motivation behind this was to further understand basic HTML and CSS code as well as how to condense and organize them more properly. I built this because it helped me understand those concepts while doing it "hands on" which helps me learn alot more. By doing this, the code was more user friendly and anyone that comes in after me will have an eaisier time looking and finding things in this code. This also helped me understand HTML semantic elements a bit more, as well as different basic commands in CSS.
