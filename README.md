# TITLE
Horiseon website rework


## DESCRIPTION
Horiseon had asked me to go into there code and rework it to make it more user friendly and clean.
My motivation behind this was to further understand basic HTML and CSS code as well as how to condense and organize them more properly. I built this because it helped me understand those concepts while doing it "hands on" which helps me learn alot more. By doing this, the code was more user friendly and anyone that comes in after me will have an eaisier time looking and finding things in this code. This also helped me understand HTML semantic elements a bit more, as well as different basic commands in CSS.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.

## Features

If your project has a lot of features, list them here.

## How to Contribute

If you created an application or package and would like other developers to contribute it, you can include guidelines for how to do so. The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) is an industry standard, but you can always write your own if you'd prefer.

## Tests

Go the extra mile and write tests for your application. Then provide examples on how to run them here.
